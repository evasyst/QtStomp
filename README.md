Qt5 Implementation of STOMP 1.2 Client Protocol

** This library is incomplete, and whilst it might possibly be interesting to look at for inspiration, it's not in a fit state to use directly as a library. I no longer have any need for it, but I'm leaving it online anyway in case it's of interest to someone else who finds themselves starting a similar project. **
